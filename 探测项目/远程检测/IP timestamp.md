# IP Timestamp

## introducing IP Timestamp

IP Timestamp is an optional extension to the IP header. It allows the sender to request
timestamp values from any machine which handles the packet by specifying itâ€™s IP address.

IP Timestamp can help us answer some of these questions.

Timestamps is 32 bits of milliseconds since midnight UT that are used in various network protocols, such as IP, ICMP and TCP. IP was designed to support extensibility using IP options
[25]. IP timestamp options are variable-length data that are stored in the IP header and are associated with a particular extension type. One of the options allows the sender to request
timestamp values from any target machine which handles the packet by specifying its IP address. A timestamp is the current time of an event that is recorded by a computer. This research hypothesized that a VM environment could be detected by comparing the behavior patterns of IP timestamps sent from VM target hosts and with the IP timestamps of physical machines within the same cloud computing environment
