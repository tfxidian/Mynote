# 虚拟机检测


```
tf@tf:~$ vmware-toolbox-cmd stat raw text session | grep version
version = VMware ESX 6.7.0 build-15160138
```

在VMware workstation中  vmware-toolbox-cmd stat子命令raw无法执行，因为不支持

```shell
tf@tf:~$ vmware-toolbox-cmd help stat
stat: print useful guest and host information
Usage: vmware-toolbox-cmd stat <subcommand>

Subcommands:
   hosttime: print the host time
   speed: print the CPU speed in MHz
ESX guests only subcommands:
   sessionid: print the current session id
   balloon: print memory ballooning information
   swap: print memory swapping information
   memlimit: print memory limit information
   memres: print memory reservation information
   cpures: print CPU reservation information
   cpulimit: print CPU limit information
   raw [<encoding> <stat name>]: print raw stat information
      <encoding> can be one of 'text', 'json', 'xml', 'yaml'.
      <stat name> includes session, host, resources, vscsi and
      vnet (Some stats like vscsi are two words, e.g. 'vscsi scsi0:0').
      Prints the available stats if <encoding> and <stat name>
      arguments are not specified.

esxi
```
ethtool -i ens160 | head -2
driver: vmxnet3
version: 1.4.17.0-k-NAPI
```

vmware
```
tf@tf:~$ ethtool -i ens33 | head -2
driver: e1000
version: 5.11.0-49-generic

```
上面的差异不能说明什么，vmxnet3和e1000这两种都可能有


## KVM 
```
find / -name vhost-net*
/dev/vhost-net

```
KVM 组件
```
root@ubuntu:~# ethtool -i eth0 | head 2
driver: virtio_net
version: 1.0.0

```

## hyper-v
```
ethtool -i eth0 
driver: hv_netvsc
```



## 远程检测
The four techniques we’ve discussed so far detect a VME locally. Other
techniques are being analyzed to detect a VME remotely. One technique that has
great promise is to look for timing anomalies in the timestamps associated with
ICMP and TCP. We’ve developed an in-house tool for measuring the
discrepancies introduced by virtual clocks, which give us an 80% success rate in
identifying VMEs remotely.
Also, because different operating systems assign the IP ID values of packets they
send differently, it might be possible to identify a VME using NAT networking
based on the IP ID values. For example, Windows machines set their IP ID
values incrementally, while Linux machines set IP ID values to a pseudo random
number. If we have a VMware machine with NAT networking for a Windows
guest and Linux host, the observed packets coming from a single IP address could
have IP ID values of A, B, C, C+1, C+2, C+3, D, E, C+4, C+5, F, and so on.
What we are witnessing is the Linux IP ID values (A, B, C, D, E, and F)
intermixed with the incremental Windows IP ID values (C+1, C+2, C+3, etc.)
Another remote VME detection mechanism is to look for patterns in the packets
that are set by virtual machines. We haven’t yet identified any in our research,
but are looking for them.
